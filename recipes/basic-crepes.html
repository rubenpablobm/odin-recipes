        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, 
                this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and 
                sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching 
                libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first 
                muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. But it's well 
                worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the 
                most popular to this day.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
                    <li>1/2 lime</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 cup of ice cubes</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 ounces of white rum</li>
                    <li>1/2 of club soda</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush 
                        to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
                    <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release 
                        the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour in rum and fill the glass with 
                        club soda.</li>
                    <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
                </ol>
