            <p>
                Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from 
                ingredients that everyone has on hand.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in 
                        the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the 
                        batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with 
                        a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
                    <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, 
                        turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
