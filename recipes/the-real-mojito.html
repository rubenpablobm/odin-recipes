        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, 
                this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and 
                sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching 
                libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first 
                muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. But it's well 
                worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the 
                most popular to this day.
