    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, 
            this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and 
            sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching 
            libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first 
            muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. But it's well 
            worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the 
            most popular to this day.
